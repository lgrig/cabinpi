### Ideas of what I want in the cabin -->
  - Text notification if temperature ever drops below 35 degrees
  - PiHole removal of all add traffic/DNS server
  - License plate detector, speed camera, twitter bot https://gregtinkers.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/car-speed-detector/
  - Timed drip line

NOTE: DS18B20 must be on GPIO7, have not been able to get any other GPIO to work regardless of dtoverlay settings.
